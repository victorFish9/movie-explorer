ðŸ”§ 1. Movie Explorer:
An application for searching movies using a public API (TMDB).
Users can search for movies, view details, and save favorites.

This project helped me practice and learn many useful things in frontend development:

I used React Router v6 to create different pages, like search, movie details, and favorites.

I learned how to use Context API to store favorite movies and share them between pages.

I connected to the TMDB API to get real movie data and showed it in the app.

I practiced making async requests, showing a loading message, and handling errors if something goes wrong.

I used localStorage to save favorite movies, so they donâ€™t disappear after refreshing the page.

I wrote my code using TypeScript, which helped me catch mistakes and write more reliable code.

I styled everything with Tailwind CSS, making the app look nice and work well on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

I used a small tool called clsx to change styles depending on the current page.

I started the app with Vite and TypeScript, which made everything run fast.

At the end, I deployed the app to Vercel for free and made it available online.
